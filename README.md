# HW3 JavaScript: Password Generator

## The Application

I created an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria theyâ€™ve selected by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

## Features

This application will generate a password by prompting the user to choose the following: 
* Whether the password should include at least 1 lowercase character 
* Whether the password should include at least 1 uppercase character 
* Whether the password should include at least 1 numeric character 
* Whether the password should include at least 1 special character 
* Whether the password has a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters

## Error Handling

This application will show an error message for the following cases: 
* If the user has not selected any criteria for characters 
* If the user does not enter a number in for the length of password 
* If the user does not enter a number between 8 and 128 characters 

Note: For any floating numbers enterd into the prompt, the application will floor the number into an integer.
